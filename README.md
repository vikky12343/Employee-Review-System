Employee Review System 

This web application facilitates employee feedback submission and management. Employees can provide feedback on each other's performance, with designated roles for both employees and administrators. The application offers distinct dashboard pages based on the user's role. Administrators have the capability to assign reviews to employees and manage employee details, while employees can only submit feedback for assigned reviews.
